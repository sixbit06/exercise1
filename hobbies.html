        <h2>music.</h2>
        <p>when i was young, music plays a crucial role in my life. it helps me express my emotions w/out entertaining other people.
            from being sad, lonely, gloomy days and also when it comes to boosting my dopamine. music has been my everything since then.</p>
        <p>while listening i always thought of making one, and that's how my career started. in 2020, the pandemic started and i was
            bored. i was searching stuff on the internet and an idea crossed my mind to create one. after searching and learning i
            started to adapt and master in creating a whole music from beat making, set up recording, and to engineer the whole track.</p>
        <p>w/out music i am nothing.</p>

        <div class="games">
        <h2>games.</h2>
        <p>games has been one of my escapes since then. playing til morning and having fun with my friends has been my daily routine when i was a kid.
           i play dota 2, csgo, and many more. usually i started playing at 5pm after class til 12am, everyday.</p>
        <p>playing these kinds of games helped me to be more analytical when it comes to solving difficult problems and adapt to difficult situations.</p>
